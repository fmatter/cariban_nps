# Introduction: [lg](pan)
* [src](payne1993nonconfigurationality) discusses discontinuous nominal expressions in [lg](pan):

[ex](pan-0,pan-1,pan-2,pan-3)


# Adnominal modification in the Cariban family
* possible combinations:
    * N[gl](~mod~) + N
    * ADV + N
    * DEM + N
* all modifying elements can also occur without a noun
    * demonstratives form standalone NPs
* property concepts are either expressed by nouns ('the big one') or adverbially [psrc](meira2009property)

# Adnominal modification in [lg](pan)
* combinations attested as discontinuous can occur adjacently, too
* our question: in what sense can these be considered constituents?
    * flexible order [psrc](payne1993nonconfigurationality[128]):
        * *arakon asa'* / *asa' arakon* 'two monkeys'
        * *arakon ta'me単e* / *ta'me単e arakon* 'many monkeys'
        * *s誰j perikura* 'this movie', *kamicha s誰j* 'this shirt'
    * no salient structure, apart from modifying and referential semantics
* contrast with "genitive" NPs:
    * fixed possessor-possessum order
    * linking prefix on possessum
    * complementary distribution of lexical possessor and third person prefix
    * prosodic integration

[manex](nps)

* possessive NP (along with PP and transitive VP) reconstructible to Proto-Cariban

# Our study
* we searched modified nouns in corpora from five Cariban languages, each 1000 records:
    * [lg](tri) [psrc](meiraDBtrio)
    * [lg](hix) ([src](derbyshire1965textos) via [src](meiraDBhixka))
    * [lg](mak) [psrc](caceresDByekwana,caceres2014elar)
    * [lg](aka) [psrc](akawaiocaesar2003)
    * [lg](yab) [psrc](caceres2020flex,caceres2022yawarana)
* first finding: these are rare in general
[table](basic-counts)

# Investigated languages
![ ](figures/map.svg)

* convenience sample
* 5 languages with annotated corpora, first sounding
* note: Venezuelan branch is not solidly established

# Nouns with modifiers
[table](types)
1. very rare in [lg](hix)
2. salient pattern: DEM + N in the three Venezuelan languages

# Nouns with modifiers: demonstratives
* [DEM N], but also [N DEM]

[ex](ps-duck-story-021,ps-duck-story-087)

# Nouns with modifiers: demonstratives
[ex](ctoabjpic-088,ctoyude-176)

# Nouns with modifiers: demonstratives
[ex](ctowaru-53,ctorosq-73)

# Nouns with modifiers: demonstratives
* fairly large proportion of total tokens:

[table](n+dem)

* as in [lg](pan), order is not absolute
* not in favor of constituency

# Nouns with modifiers: nouns with other modifiers

[table](nummod)
[table](advmod)
[table](nmod)

[todo](I will insert some examples on a separate slide)


# Modified nouns as arguments of postpositions
[ex](dados-09-kereramake-p-041-270)
[ex](mini-disc-lsmtam13set0001-marciano-little-introduction-005)

# Modified nouns as arguments of postpositions

# Modified nouns as arguments of transitive verbs

[table](vtarg)

# Modified nouns as possessors: bracketing paradox
[ex](ra-eagle-story-034,ctoabjpic-027,ctorosq-66)

# Discontinuity: intervening particles
[todo](I will show **some** intervening phrasal particles, then show same particles with bonafide NPs)

# Discontinuity: intervening intransitive verbs
[ex](data-01-yakari-01-p-127-022)

[ex](ctoabjpic-094)

* only 5 examples

# Discontinuity: intervening adverbs

[ex](convchur-009)

* only 2 examples

# Discontinuity: A noun

[ex](ctoabjpic-008)

# Diachrony: afterthoughts
* starting point are afterthought constructions
* very common still in [lg](hix) [psrc](hixkaryanaderby1985[101-104, 129-135])

[ex](derbyshire-1965-p-061-the-wives-of-mawarye-and-woxka-040,
derbyshire-1965-p-040-the-buzzard-people-and-their-servant-the-sloth-109,

# Diachrony: afterthoughts

[ex](ctoabjpic-003)
[ex](dados-09-kereramake-p-047-374)
[ex](ctowaru-19)

# Diachrony: prosodically integrated afterthoughts
* **afterthoughts become less "separated" from clause & prosodically integrated**
[ex](derbyshire-1965-p-019-the-origin-of-night-and-darkness-081)

[ex](ctowaru-36)

# Diachrony: prosodically integrated afterthoughts
[ex](mini-disc-lsmtam13set0001-marciano-little-introduction-003,

# Diachrony: prosodically integrated afterthoughts
[ex](histgrme-134)

* yielded innovative Panare VAP order [psrc](payne1994ovs[595],gildea2000vpgenesis)

[table](panarefreq)

# Discussion
* apparent discontinuous noun phrases are not constituents
    * they are prosodically integrated afterthoughts
    * usually not translated as afterthought (!)
* no strong evidence that even continuous coreferential elements are constituents
    * arguments of postpositions?
    * contrast with bona fide possessive NPs
    * possible exception: incipient [DEM N] in [lg](aka), [lg](mak), [lg](yab)
* raises questions about discontinuous constituents in general
