Hello Spike!

this is the repo for the NP study. Relevant for you are the following things:

* above you see a tab ["Issues"](https://github.com/fmatter/cariban_nps/issues), where we can discuss problematic analyses etc. on a case-by-case basis
    * I've added labels; when handling issues, focus on the ones with the label [urgent](https://github.com/fmatter/cariban_nps/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aurgent). Also relevant is 'interesting'. I made [one big issue](https://github.com/fmatter/cariban_nps/issues/12) for all the particles.
    * once an issue has been resolved (in the case of the urgent ones, this will usually result in 'yes, discontinuous NP', 'no, drop it', or 'we can't make sense of this' being annotated in the data), it can be closed ([example for closed issue](https://github.com/fmatter/cariban_nps/issues/6))
* an up-to-date summary of the results is in the file [overview.md](overview.md)
* it is based on the files in the [data](data) folder, which also hosts a simple [CLDF dataset](data/cldf) with the relevant examples
* the handout & slides based on the data will live in [docs](docs)
* Git is a version control system, where every change is explicitly recorded and where the state at a given point in time can be retrieved. Above the list of files you see ["XX commits"](https://github.com/fmatter/cariban_nps/commits/main), which shows the editing history.


* Introduction: Payne (1993) on discontinuous constituents in Panare
   * A couple of examples from Payne
   * Claim: discontinuous NP = coreferential adjoined nouns
   * Our question: in what sense is this an NP?
   * Our study: look at text from five related languages (from anstract)
      * First finding: in discourse, these things are RARE!
   * Outline of the talk from here
*  Reconstructible Prior State: adjoined nouns, afterthought constructions
   *  Hixkaryana as modern exemplar
      * Afterthoughts are really common
   *  Some examples from the other 4 languages that are consistent
      * Different kinds of discontinuity
         *  Major class words intervening
         *  Phrasal/scope particles intervening (we don't consider this discontinuous, as not different from possessive construction)
*  Pattern 1: afterthoughts become less "separated" from clause
   *  Data from Tiriyó showing afterthoughts (apparently w/o pauses)
      * Flag future work: checking sound files from Tiriyó
   * This is clearly what has happened in Panare VSO order (cite Payne 1994 for frequencies, Gildea 2000 for mechanism)
* Pattern 2: coreferential nouns begin to cohere into something resembling continuous NPs
   * [Dem + N] (also [N + Dem]?)
      * Data from Ye'kwana, Yawarana
      * May need to order these depending on what we find
   * Adding other elements
      * Data from Akawaio
* Discussion (in place of conclusions)
   * Clearly there are discontinuities in the texts, and not all are separated by pause/intonation contours
   * Not so clear that they instantiate a theoretical notion of "NP"
   * Not so clear that even continuous coreferring elements instantiate a theoretical notion of NP
   * But one seems to be developing
      * [DEM N]
      * more elaborated in Akawaio (presumably influenced by English)
