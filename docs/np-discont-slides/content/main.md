# Introduction: [lg](pan)
* [src](payne1993nonconfigurationality) discusses discontinuous nominal expressions in [lg](pan):

[ex](pan-0,pan-1,pan-2,pan-3)


# Introduction: [lg](pan)

* flexible order [psrc](payne1993nonconfigurationality[128]):
    * *arakon asa'* / *asa' arakon* 'two monkeys'
    * *arakon ta'meñe* / *ta'meñe arakon* 'many monkeys'
    * *sïj perikura* 'this movie', *kamicha sïj* 'this shirt'
* our question: in what sense can these be considered constituents?
* constituency tests:
    * boundary phenomena don't help
    * second position particles: no positive evidence [todo](hoff 1995)
    * internal order / hierarchical structure: flexible
[todo](examples for bonafide NPs)
[todo](mention patterns)

# Adnominal modification in the Cariban family
* parts can occur as standalone nouns, no required dependents
* property concepts are nouns
* demonstratives can also be NPs
* G&M 2009 

# Our study
* we looked at corpora from five Cariban languages, each 1000 records:
    * [lg](tri) [psrc](meiraDBtrio)
    * [lg](hix) ([src](derbyshire1965textos) via [src](meiraDBhixka))
    * [lg](mak) [psrc](caceresDByekwana)
    * [lg](aka) [psrc](caesarDBakawaio)
    * [lg](yab) [psrc](caceres2020flex)
[todo](what kind of count do we show here?)
* first finding: modified nouns in general are rare
[table](basic-counts)
[todo](Outline of the talk from here)

# Investigated languages
![Treemap](figures/map.svg)
[todo](justification of sample)

# What is reconstructible?
*  reconstructible prior state: adjoined nouns, afterthought constructions [todo](did you mean "coreferential" here? )
* very common in [lg](hix) [psrc](hixkaryanaderby1985[101-104, 129-135])

[ex](derbyshire-1965-p-061-the-wives-of-mawarye-and-woxka-040,
derbyshire-1965-p-040-the-buzzard-people-and-their-servant-the-sloth-109,
derbyshire-1965-p-062-the-wives-of-mawarye-and-woxka-071)

   *  Hixkaryana as modern exemplar
      * Afterthoughts are really common
   *  [todo]("Some examples from the other 4 languages that are consistent")
      * Different kinds of discontinuity
         *  Major class words intervening
         *  Phrasal/scope particles intervening (we don't consider this discontinuous, as not different from possessive construction)


# Pattern 1: nouns with modifiers
[table](types)
* RARE

# Pattern 2.1: nouns with demonstratives

* [Dem + N] (also [N + Dem]?)
[todo](examples for DEM N)
* Data from Ye'kwana, Yawarana, Akawaio
* May need to order these depending on what we find

[table](n+dem)

[todo](examples for N DEM)

* constituency tests still negative -- counterexamples everywhere

# Pattern 2.2: nouns with other modifiers
* with numerals and with modifying nouns
* show examples
* show counts & order

# Pattern 2.3: modified nouns as arguments
* pNP POSTP
    * N POSTP N POSTP
    * N POSTP N
* pNP Vt
    * N Vt N
* possessed nouns and ambiguity

# Pattern 3: intervening particles
[todo](show intervening particles, then show same particles with bonafide NPs)

# Pattern 4: other intervening elements
* eclectic mix

# Diachrony: prosodically integrated afterthoughts
*  Pattern 1: afterthoughts become less "separated" from clause
   *  Data from Tiriyó showing afterthoughts (apparently w/o pauses)
   * This is clearly what has happened in Panare VSO order
      * (cite [src](payne1994ovs) for frequencies, [src](gildea2000vpgenesis) for mechanism)

# Discussion
* there is nothing constituent-y here, except maybe DEM N
* Discussion (in place of conclusions)
   * Clearly there are discontinuities in the texts, and not all are separated by pause/intonation contours
   * Not so clear that they instantiate a theoretical notion of "NP"
   * Not so clear that even continuous coreferring elements instantiate a theoretical notion of NP
   * But one seems to be developing
      * [DEM N]
      * more elaborated in Akawaio (presumably influenced by English)
