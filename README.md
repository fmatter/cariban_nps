Hello Spike!

this is the repo for the NP study. Relevant for you are the following things:

* above you see a tab ["Issues"](https://github.com/fmatter/cariban_nps/issues), where we can discuss problematic analyses etc. on a case-by-case basis
    * I've added labels; when handling issues, focus on the ones with the label [urgent](https://github.com/fmatter/cariban_nps/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aurgent). Also relevant is 'interesting'. I made [one big issue](https://github.com/fmatter/cariban_nps/issues/12) for all the particles.
    * once an issue has been resolved (in the case of the urgent ones, this will usually result in 'yes, discontinuous NP', 'no, drop it', or 'we can't make sense of this' being annotated in the data), it can be closed ([example for closed issue](https://github.com/fmatter/cariban_nps/issues/6))
* an up-to-date summary of the results is in the file [overview.md](overview.md)
* it is based on the files in the [data](data) folder, which also hosts a simple [CLDF dataset](data/cldf) with the relevant examples
* the handout & slides based on the data will live in [docs](docs)
* Git is a version control system, where every change is explicitly recorded and where the state at a given point in time can be retrieved. Above the list of files you see ["XX commits"](https://github.com/fmatter/cariban_nps/commits/main), which shows the editing history.
