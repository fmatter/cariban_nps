# Introduction: [lg](pan)
* [src](payne1993nonconfigurationality) discusses discontinuous nominal expressions in [lg](pan):

[ex](pan-0,pan-1,pan-2,pan-3)


# Introduction: [lg](pan)

* flexible order [psrc](payne1993nonconfigurationality[128]):
    * *arakon asa'* / *asa' arakon* 'two monkeys'
    * *arakon ta'meñe* / *ta'meñe arakon* 'many monkeys'
    * *sïj perikura* 'this movie', *kamicha sïj* 'this shirt'
* claim: discontinuous NP = coreferential adjoined nouns [todo](what?)
* our question: in what sense is this an NP? [todo](who said that?)
* we looked at corpora from five Cariban languages, each 1000 records:
    * [lg](tri) [psrc](meiraDBtrio)
    * [lg](hix) ([src](derbyshire1965textos) via [src](meiraDBhixka))
    * [lg](mak) [psrc](caceresDByekwana)
    * [lg](aka) [psrc](caesarDBakawaio)
    * [lg](yab) [psrc](caceres2020flex)
[todo](what kind of count do we show here?)
* first finding: rare
[table](basic-counts)
[todo](Outline of the talk from here)

# Investigated languages
![Treemap](figures/map.svg)

# What is reconstructible?
*  reconstructible prior state: adjoined nouns, afterthought constructions [todo](did you mean "coreferential" here? )
* very common in [lg](hix) [psrc](hixkaryanaderby1985[101-104, 129-135])

[ex](derbyshire-1965-p-061-the-wives-of-mawarye-and-woxka-040,
derbyshire-1965-p-052-the-origin-of-mawarye-and-woxka-235,
derbyshire-1965-p-062-the-wives-of-mawarye-and-woxka-071)

   *  Hixkaryana as modern exemplar
      * Afterthoughts are really common
   *  [todo]("Some examples from the other 4 languages that are consistent")
      * Different kinds of discontinuity
         *  Major class words intervening
         *  Phrasal/scope particles intervening (we don't consider this discontinuous, as not different from possessive construction)


# Pattern 1
*  Pattern 1: afterthoughts become less "separated" from clause
   *  Data from Tiriyó showing afterthoughts (apparently w/o pauses)
      * Flag future work: checking sound files from Tiriyó
   * This is clearly what has happened in Panare VSO order (cite [src](payne1994ovs) for frequencies, [src](gildea2000vpgenesis) for mechanism)

[table](lg_type)

# Pattern 2
* Pattern 2: coreferential nouns begin to cohere into something resembling continuous NPs
   * [Dem + N] (also [N + Dem]?)
      * Data from Ye'kwana, Yawarana
      * May need to order these depending on what we find
[ex](ctorat-34)

   * Adding other elements
      * Data from Akawaio

# Discussion
* Discussion (in place of conclusions)
   * Clearly there are discontinuities in the texts, and not all are separated by pause/intonation contours
   * Not so clear that they instantiate a theoretical notion of "NP"
   * Not so clear that even continuous coreferring elements instantiate a theoretical notion of NP
   * But one seems to be developing
      * [DEM N]
      * more elaborated in Akawaio (presumably influenced by English)
