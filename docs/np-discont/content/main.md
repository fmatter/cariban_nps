# [lg](tri) (959 records) [label](sec:tri)

## Good examples

* note the absence of commas in the [lg](tri) line as opposed to the translation -- other records have plenty of them

* *mëërë* and *tamutupë* ("Këreramakë"):

[ex](dados-09-kereramake-p-043-278)

* *mëe* and *okomo awekïïton* (an NP itself? "Frog story"):

[ex](dados-07-frog-story-marciano-p-089-032)

* *mëe* and *inmukuhpë*:
[ex](dados-09-kereramake-p-049-415)

* *mono […] kïrïmuku*:
[ex](data-01-yakari-01-p-127-022)

* *tarïpi* and *mëërë* (or is *mëërë* 'he'?):

[ex](dados-09-kereramake-p-049-392)

* *mëe* and *Sesu*?
[ex](mini-disc-lsmtam13set0001-marciano-little-introduction-004)

## Unclear examples
* these touch on a larger issue: commas in the [lg](tri) transcription are often an important criterion; how reliable are they?

* if there were no commas between *mëërë ja* and *werekeru ja*, I would classify them as a single NP:
[ex](dados-09-kereramake-p-047-374)

* conversely, in this example the morphosyntax suggests to me that there are two clauses in the first part: 1) 'leave this one here' and 'your son would disturb you'

## Weird examples

* *pïtai* 'shoe' is repeated:

[ex](dados-07-frog-story-marciano-p-089-015)

* this looks like 3 coreferential NPs in a row? (not counting *Përëpërëwa*)

[ex](dados-09-kereramake-p-033-077)

* 'this one her son they'?
